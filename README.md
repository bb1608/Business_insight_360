Introducing "Business Insights 360" - an innovative solution created for AtliQ Hardware, Atliq, a company that manufactures hardware, sells its products to various customers like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart. These customers then sell the products to end consumers through both online platforms and physical stores. Although Atliq's business is thriving globally, they have faced significant challenges in Latin America. Despite their efforts to establish their own stores in the region, they suffered major losses. The primary reason for this failure was their reliance on inaccurate survey data. Until now, Atliq used Excel for all their data analysis needs. However, as they have grown into a large company, Excel is no longer sufficient. To make better data-driven decisions, Atliq has sought the help of a data analytics team. As a team member, my task is to create a Power BI report that will provide valuable insights from the data.This project redefines data analysis, providing real-time, actionable insights for our Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams.
